This repository is created for the WordPress Automation assessment given by WPPOOL. You can find my Cypress test files in the 'Cypress/integration/examples' directory of this repository.

I have used the Cypress automation tool for completing Question E. I used VSCODE for running my JavaScript code in Cypress.
